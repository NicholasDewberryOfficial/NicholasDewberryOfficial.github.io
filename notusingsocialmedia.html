<h4> Not using social media from middle School - College. Pros + cons</h4>

<br> <p> I'm a pretty extroverted guy, and I meet a lot of people. A lot of them are interested in meeting with me, and want to learn more. 

    <br> However due to how I live my life, there ends up being a pretty unique problem. 

    <h5> "Wait, so you don't use social media?" </h5>

    <br> I don't use any social media at all. Let me explain. No insta, snap, facebook, tik-tok or whatever useless BS is out now. 

    <br> NOTE:  I only use Discord and that's it. The way I use it does not resemble most social media platforms, and I will go into detail about it.

    <br> I just wanted to go over what it was like to not use social media, the pros + cons, and if I'd reccomend others to do it. 

    <br> The pros: 
    <ul>
        <li>Fantastic mental health. People my age are racked with anxiety, depression and a lot of stress due to social media. Everyone wants attention, but no one wants to be the main character. Not having social media allowed me to be authentic, able to approach others, and forge more genuine connections.</li>
        <li>Low fantasies, high realities. When speaking to others/dating/working out, social media has a tendency to give people a perverted view of perfection and themselves. I'm able to approach things as they are. </li>
        <li>Not needing to look my best to feel my best. So many people randomly take pictures of themselves doing things, and I think that would drive me crazy. The pressure is insane.</li>
    </ul>

    <br> The cons: 
    <ul> 
        <li>People thinking I'm weird, at a glance. Everyone is using social media, and not using it is seen as strange. One of the reasons I have this site is to alleviate this issue (lol) </li>
        <li>Lost connections with people due to my lack of social media use. Thinking back, I could've dated/befriended many more people during College if I had social media. It ended up being that we would have a good chat, they would ask to contact me again, but then they wouldn't feel comfortable giving their number out. Social media lets people have a picture of themselves, and people want to see that from me. </li>
        <li>Lost spontaneous connections. A lot of guys message girls on insta, they talk for a month THEN they meet in person. This is very different from my method of meeting people (I.E, going up to them to talk)</li>
        <li>Not getting how others act. There's times when I'm in class and at the end I try to talk to other people. Every now and again someone's like "why are you talking to me" and I never understood why. My friends don't either, so I chalk it up to just being unfamiliar with others.  </li>
        <li>Missing party/social events due to not paying attention. In college a lot of people sold tickets, so if you were someone who was in the first 100 to see a post, then you were able to have an exclusive and good time. Me? Not so much. Looking for parties always felt like pulling teeth. I had to approach random people to see what the move is. I knew someone who was a party promoter but they were more interested in trying to get me to buy 5$ tickets for 20$ (I didn't, I always used a third party, thank god) </li>        
    </ul>

    <br> A question arises. "Why is discord so different?"

    <br> Discord is a powerful servant and addendum to my social life. I'm able to have large group chats where I talk to others. We can coordinate plans, ideas and other ways to spend our time. It doesn't REPLACE social interaction like most social media, but it's an amplifier. 

    <br> With that being said, the amplification power goes both ways. It's really easy to find people who don't touch grass, and then join them in cyberspace. If you're lonely IRL, it makes sense to find community online. 

    <br> If I were to do everything over, I'd say use insta and snap CASUALLY. Don't post anything on there, don't stalk others, but respond to posts that include me and try to keep in touch with people who like me. It's a hard balance, but if I could accomplish it, then that would be good - I think.
