<h1> NOW </h1>

<h3> If you were to see me for the first time in 2 years, what would stick out to you? </h3>

<ul>
    <li> I'm still developing video games and programming in my free time. I like socializing, but it feels great for me to just put some headphones on, and relax by spending time with myself</li>
    <li> I'm still trying to write a book. I've read a lot of them as a kid, and I feel like the ideas I had when I was 8 years old are still good.</li>
    <li> I'm still working at A&T, maintaining over 500k worth of equipment. Once I go direct to PhD, that number's gonna rise to over 1 million, lol</li>
    <li> I want to do some consulting work, but </li>
</ul>
