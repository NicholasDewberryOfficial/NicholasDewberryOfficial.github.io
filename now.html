<div class="maincontent"> 

<ul>
    <li> I'm still developing video games and programming in my free time. I like socializing, but it feels great for me to just put some headphones on, and focus on my projects (like this blog lol)</li>
    <li> I'm still working at A&T, maintaining over 500k worth of equipment. I graduated, and took a break from December-August. Once I start my masters, I'll be back to working.</li>
    <li> I'm in a relationship with a girl I love! If you're in NC, and you want to have a double date with us, just let me know! </li>
    <li> Add me on linkedin!!!!</li>
    
</ul>

<p> What am I no longer doin? </p>
<ul>
<li> Writing a book. I still want to, but I don't have 200 hours to dedicate to it, unfortunatley.</li>

</ul>
