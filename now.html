<h1> NOW </h1>

<h3> If you were to see me for the first time in 2 years, what would stick out to you? </h3>

<ul>
    <li> I'm still developing video games and programming in my free time. I like socializing, but it feels great for me to just put some headphones on, and focus on my projects (like this blog lol)</li>
    <li> I'm still trying to write a book. I've read a lot of them as a kid, and I feel like the ideas I had when I was 8 years old are still good.</li>
    <li> I'm still working at A&T, maintaining over 500k worth of equipment. Once I go direct to PhD, that number's gonna rise to over 1 million. I'll be busy for quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I want to do some consulting work, but I don't think I have the skills for it. If I can do game dev as a side hustle while I do my PhD, I'll be really happy - but im not sure if I have the skillset for that. </li>
    <li> I like NASA a lot. Hopefully I can work there. </li>
</ul>
