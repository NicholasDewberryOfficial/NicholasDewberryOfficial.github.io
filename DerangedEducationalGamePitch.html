<h5>This is just theorycrafting, and an idea that I've been chewing on for a while.</h5>


<h4> A background to my experiences with education</h4>
<p>
    <br> When it comes to education in the United States, I'm pretty sure all of us knows how it goes. 

    <br> We have classrooms where students learn things, and in most cases It's doing pretty fine. We have a population who can read, use computers and community effectively [your mileage may very].

    <br> But when it comes to the practicality of our education, I can't help but wonder what the point of it all is. I once had a book called "The scarlet letter" that I was forced to read for an AP Lit class. 

    <br> This book, for all intents and purposes, is a horrible read. Especially if you judge it by modern standards. The prose is slow and unimaginative, the dialogue is unrealistic and the story itself does not appeal to me in the slightest. 

    <br> There's one good quote with the "electric chain" when the main character's daughter held hands with her parents, and the mystery behind who is the father is done well. 

    <br> But otherwise, there's not much for me in the book. Reading it is a waste of time - I don't earn anything. 

    <br> With that being said, I had a lot of fun discussing the book in class. I got a lot from listening to how others interpreted the book, its themes/scenes and what the author was trying to communicate. 

    <br> I only bring this up because I listened to the "Great american novel podcast"  a while back when they had an episode on the Scarlet Letter. It was really cool how the author was trying to create a story about having dignity in the face of injustice.

    <br> However if you really break it down, I was forced to read this crappy novel, that only got redeemed in my eyes by having people either discuss with me how the book was meaningful or by listening to an academic talk about how the book was done well.

    <br> I think about this book quite a bit, and how it kind of relates to a lot of what I know.

<h4> Math education</h4>
<p>
    <br> A lot of children who take math always ask the same question. 
    
    <br> <b> Why does this matter. Why am I learning this. I could be doing anything else </b>

    <br> A common response to a lot of these kids is just to tell them "shut up" or some vague reference of how the process of learning math will help them solve hard problems down the line. 

    <br> I only started not hating math when I internalized the futility of it all. Here I am being judged for some extremely difficult work and there's nothing I can do about it.

    <br> <i> There's nothing I can do except for be good at it.</i> I had to grind out calculus and precalculus problems hard, dedicating at least an hour every week to looking over problems.

    <br> Later on, for linear algebra and differential equations, I had to do a ton of practice drills daily, almost 2 a day hours to do good in these difficult classes. 

    <br> When I could just treat math as a stupid obstacle, I was able to rise up the occasion. 

    <br> But something makes me wonder if there's a way I could bridge the gap between how students experience math (boring, not engaging, something no one cares about)

<h4> The pitch  </h4>

    <br> The year is 1930 and our world is at peace. Due to the destruction worldwide from a brutal world war, humanity has finally moved past the point of
