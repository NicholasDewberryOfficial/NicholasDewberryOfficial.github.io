    This page has 3 different sides to it. There's the one that I wrote back in fall 2023, and one that I wrote in Winter 2024 - and the most recent once in Spring 2024.  

    <br> I'm including all 3 articles here for my blog. Because I think it's funny to see how much my opinion changed over time.

<p> Overwatch is really good, actually. Suprisingly so. I've played my share of fps games, and a lot of them aren't my style. I like fast games
<br>
    Here's some reasons why I might like OW2 so much. 

    <ul>
        <li> High TTK. I love not getting 1 shot. There's snipers, but you can do a lot with LOS/movement to mess them up.  </li>
        <li> The game is very creative, and encourages quick thinking.</li>
        <li> Every game plays differently, and I can experiment a lot. Games are short too, and theres a ton of "meat" to the matches. You aren't just standing around/waiting like a lot of other FPS games (looking at you FAKE tactical games [valorant, r6]) </li>
    </ul>
</p>

    Disregard my last blog post. EVERYTHING about it was wrong.
    <br>

    -Unemployed widowmakers 1 shot everything and its impossible to heal/get healed 
    <br>

    -I literally cannot play DPS because aiming is so hard in this game 
    <br>

    -So many characters I like are not meta

    <ul> 
        <li> I only picked up Muaga AFTER the nerf hammer took his knees. Big mistake. Bro does NOTHING now. Dude is an oompa loompa that gets zen orbed and dies.</li>
        <li> Rein doesn't even work in this game anymore.  </li>
        <li> When I play Zarya, shes inconsistent. </li>
        <li> Creative characters like symmetra are not playable. What a pity. </li>
        <li> KEKW I wasted so much time trying to learn Illari, my mistake. </li>
        <li> I know I can play whoever I want in quickplay, but the meta picks in comp are just so hard to deal with. </li>
    </ul>

    Wow. To make things even more difficult, the game got a pretty hefty season 9 patch that changed everything around. 
    
    <br> Most of my complaints are dealt with. Huh. 

    <br> I'm back to liking overwatch now. I'm at a point where the playerbase is really good in my matches, but I still have fun and enjoy myself. 

    <br> Even during losses  I feel like I do a lot.
    
    <br> Season 9 was the best thing the devs could've done. 

    <br> I play with a group of 3-5, so everything about the game feels good. If you wanna add me, just shoot me an invite on battle.net (Enalaps (i forget the number but I can come up with it later)) and we can play sometime. I'm usually free after 6pm.

    <br> Once I add comments, I'll make yall type down stuff so we can chat about the state of the game. For me its been nothing but great.

    <br> What's the point of playing a competitive game when I could use my time programming/being productive? I aged out of overwatch.
