        Hello everyone! Welcome to my Fun Site. This is a place for me to
        creatively express myself, and tell the world how I feel about stuff.
        This is very casual, so don't take this as a fundemental measure of my
        skills. i made this site in 2023, and i'm upkeeping the horrible .css i
        wrote.

        <br />
        This website is why I talk about using daisyui/shadCN/tailwindCSS so
        much. This site compared to some of my other sites (<a
            href="https://purposepathways.netlify.app/static/index.html"
            )
        >
            Like this</a
        >) looks primitive and retro.
        <b> BTW That image is done on purpose. </b>

        <br />
        Here is where I'll be posting blog updates, personal thoughts on things,
        and other stuff.
