<p>
    Hello everyone! Welcome to my temporary website. I wanted to make something in astro - but it was too complicated. I've been trying to develop a really good looking website with a good frontend for MONTHS now, and it's way outside of the scope of my skill. 

    <br> This website is primitive - however it's mine. 

    <br> I'll be posting blog updates, personal thoughts on things, and other stuff.
