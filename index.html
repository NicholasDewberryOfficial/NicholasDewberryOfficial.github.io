    Hello, my name is Nicholas Dewberry. I am a Senior computer science student (I'm planning on going to grad school, so I'm still kinda far from completion) with a specialty on making computer games/ VR applications. I'm good at everything COMPSCI (even the 3d modelling math stuff, suprisingly enough)
