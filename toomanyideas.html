    BTW this has nothing to do with anything about plagarism/theft or anything similar. I know this company came up with this idea on their own. 
    <br>
    I've been trying to prototype and design a 4X Strategy game for a while now, and all of a sudden I find a AAA studio has been experimenting with the same concept. 
    <br> 
    I'm not too sure how to feel about this,as 
    <br>
    I still have my idea, but it's a little frustrating to see that I would be compared to this absurdly strong AAA studio. 

    <br> Oh well. This is just something that popped into my mind randomly. I like how even though this is detrimental to me, I'm able to take it and keep moving.

    Wow, I've got too many game ideas. I keep wanting to remake these mediocre 1-3 star games out of five from small Japanese companies. 
    <br> 
    In all of the jank, theres so many cool gameplay/story/design concepts that never get brought up again in modern gaming. Usually, that's for the better, but sometimes its not.

    I loved the eating mechanics in DDS, and it would be cool if another game could do something similar.
