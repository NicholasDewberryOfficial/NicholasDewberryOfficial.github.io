<h3> Day 5: Aug 26th 2025</h3>

        <br />
        Made a lot of progress on saving/loading and adding tasks. UI got a small little update. The more I look at the UI, the more I like it. The outline on text makes it super easy to read. 

<br/>

Right now, the tags use levinstien distance and the main tag array to classify closeness. Each time you type, the backend iterates and looks for the closest match. Future work can make this more efficient (priority queue - so only the top 3 words get checked, and they can pop in/out) but I'll do it later.

        <br />
        Saving and loading is quite simple. Tedious, but simple. We just use a godot 4 config file that I make.

            Master test of adding things onto the list, adding tags, saving and loading. If this works, Dewber Productivity will be my new daily productivity tool.

<h3> Day 2-4: Aug 23-25 2025</h3>

        <br />
        Made a lot of progress on the theme, and I had a lot of fun with exploring different color schemes and visual identities. I'd like to make this a little more frutiger - but GUI skinning can be my final step. <br/>

        The GUI works by leveraging Godot 4 themes - and they're pretty drag and drop (just 1 file). When we finalize this, we can add theme switching as a last step.
        <br />
        Went into more detail on how adding tasks looks, and unifying the UI. This is basically a lot of backend stuff, but I'm feeling pretty good so far. 
        <br>The tag database will use Godot 4 configfiles, and will be encrypted.

        <h3> Tomorrow's work: </h3>
        <br/>
            I want to find a way to solve this time Issue I'm having. I'll do it later tho. 
            
            <br /> I also have a better idea on how the tag database will work. It'll be a simple master list that we'll populate. Every task will have an array of tags - and the array of tags will be taken from the master list. If a user adds a tag thats not there - it'll be added.

<h3> Day 1: Aug 22nd 2025</h3>

        <br />
        The first day has been super productive. I started off with a custom theme (inspired by this person <a href="https://csszengarden.com/089/"> css zen garden </a>) and spent some time tweaking it. Visual design/organized design is always something I struggled with, and now after some years of doing this, I think I can build a pretty decent-ish ui.
        <br />
        I'm going for a design inspired by the 2000s (y2k), with gradients and desaturated colors. When I beauty this up, it'll look very cool.

        <br> I like how the ps3 menu is so sparkly, with transparency and other good looking particles. Once I add shaders and animation effects, this will look cool.

        <img
        src="img/day0aug22nd2025.png"
        width= "900"
        height="400"
        margin:auto />
        <h3> Future work: </h3>
        <br/>
        I want to really dial in on adding tasks and creating a persistent database. It would be easiest to just create an sqlite database and read/load from that.... But I'm not so sure. I can always just use in built config files for consistency - that should be pretty device-agnostic.

        <br/>
        Tags are also a bit harder than anticipated. Just like with discussdock, I think I want to have a master list of tags. Each tag will use bbcode for an associated color
        (not quite sure how im accomplishing this).

        <br/>
        Time is also something much more difficult than I thought. Go has a lot of easy ways of working with time... GDscript - not so much. I think I want to use unix time for everything and convert when necessary.... but I'm not sure about the long term scalability of this solution. I will eventually add hour-by-hour day planners, and converting between yyyy-mm-dd:hr-m-s-ms and unix time format will 100% be annoying. This is a system architecture question.

        <h3> What is this? </h3>
        <br/>
        TL;DR I'm dissatisfied with the current productivity tools, and I'm making one that's inspired from my own life. No science, no studies - just some tools that I feel like should exist. Because it's highly opinionated - most people probably won't find it useful.
