<h1> Homemade Thai green tea.  </h1>

<img src="img/greenthaitea.jpg" height="600" width="400">  
<p>This one was pretty easy to make. I steeped some thai tea in hot water for a bit. 
    <br> 
     Then, I took out the tea bag, and added matcha powder -with more hot water. 
     <br> Afterwards, I mixed in some erythyol sugar alternative.
     <br>  If it wasn't sweet enough for me, I then added a bunch of stevia liquid drop sweetner.
     <br> Finally, we fill up the rest of the cup with oat milk. We mix at every step btw. There should be a lot of bubbles from the hot water and the stirring.
     <br> I love drinking this, it tastes delicious. The steeped Thai tea has a very strong flavor, and the matcha is very bitter. 
     <br> It's very refreshing, and my go-to morning drink. The only downside is that it's VERY hard to transport and move around. The mason jar in this picture doesn't fit in my car (lol).
     <br> It's definetly more of a "wake up at 6 and get out the door at 8" type drink. 
     <br> I came up with this idea after going to a boba place where they had this combination. They added a TON of sugar. It tasted really good, and I think the flavor profile of matcha bitterness, thai tea strength and milky sweetness make this fantastic. 
     <br> Rating: 3/3 stars. Good in almost every scenario. Setup isn't difficult at all.

<div class="maincontent"> 
    <h1> Sleepytime tea.  </h1>
    <p>I get a bunch of these teas and drink them at least once a week before bed.
        <br> 
        It's alright. I don't think it's actually effective. 
        <br> I drink it anyway though - because what IF there's that once percent chance where it actually does something.
        <br> I drink it all the time when I have to wake up early. 
        <br> It's a good placebo - like when I drink it im like "ok i have to go to bed on time, I have to do my night routine early". 
        <br> Its cheap though and tastes good -so even if its bad, it doesnt matter. 
        <br> Rating: 2/3 stars. I drink this alot.

    <h1> Chocolate milk (Not a tea, but I don't care).  </h1>
    <p>
         <br> Rating: 100/3 stars. I'd exchange my blood for chocolate milk if I could.

        <h1> Emporers White tea.  </h1>
        <img src="img/empwhitetea.jpg" height="400" width="300" >
        <p> Wow, this is REALLY good. Like holy crap.
            <br> 
            Distinct, subtle flavor, sweet aroma, and good vibes. I love it. 
            <br> It's slightly caffeinated, so it's a good addition when I'm home and want something light. 
            <br> Probably one of the most refreshing teas I've got. I love it.
            <br> Rating: 3/3 stars. I always go for it in my tea rotation.

<div class="maincontent"> 
    <h1> English black tea bags (Twinnings, Tetley, all brands pretty much).  </h1>
    <p>
        I only had these when I was sick as a kid, with lots of honey. 
        <br> I don't like black teas as much because they require a lot of setup to make taste good. 
        <br> You have to steep it the correct amount of time to prevent it from being bitter, you have to add sweetners and stir them, you've got to do a lot.
        <br> It's heavily caffinated, so I can't eat it whenever I want.
        <br> It's also super heavy too. 
         <br> Rating: 1.5/3 stars. Conditionally good, but not worth it imo.

        <h1> Green tea.  </h1>
        <p>
            I had WAY too many of these as a kid. Every day, after school, I'd be SO tired. I'd always get this at 5pm almost every day, without fail.
            <br> Back then I used teabags, but now I just use regular matcha. 
            <br> I don't notice that much of a difference, as green tea is green tea IMO. I prefer the powder because it's easier to add milk to it.
            <br> Also, when I use teabags, I notice that theres just random leaf stuff at the bottom. I have no clue what it is.
            <br> Classic tea flavor, one of my favorites. One of the few teas I can drink boiling hot and be alright with. 
             <br> Rating: 3/3 stars. On the rotation.

        <div class="maincontent"> 
            <h1> Chamomile tea.  </h1>
            <p>
                Oh man, where to begin.
                <br> I've only drank this from teabags, so keep that in mind. 
                <br> I don't like this at all, and I dont have specific reasons why, its just a bunch of small stuff.
                <br> It FEELS heavy, even though its not. 
                <br> I remember it not tasting good, but it's flavor is forgettable. 
                <br> Adding in other things doesn't change the flavor much, which is suprising. 
                <br> Overall, one of my conditional teas. It can be really good if im feeling it. 
                <br> I've noticed a pretty large gender divide in Chamomile tea. Almost every woman I know really likes it. 
                <br> I find that interesting, because as a guy I really don't feel for it at all. 
                 <br> Rating: 1.5/3 stars. On the rotation, but only if theres no better tea.
