        Let's be clear. IT'S TIME FOR MOBA SHOOTERS TO COME BACK. I say this for two reasons:
    <ol>
        <li> Deadlock basically proves that gamers are clamoring for a high-skill and intense game filled with complicated descision making.</li>
        <li> Despite a rocky launch, Overwatch 2 managed to pull out a lot of hype.</li>

    </ol>

            nah, this game was HEAT.The gameplay felt so good.

            <br />
            It's so strange to see ow2 players grind comp when the game
            obviously isn't made to be a high-skill fps. It's more of a weird
            cooldown/coordination shooter rather than something high skill you
            could grind for 1000s of hours. <br />
            Lawbreakers feels like such an obvious game to fill that competitive
            niche overwatch created. Everything about the game is so well made
            and intense, with a tall skill ceiling and intense combat. I'd play
            the crap out of this if it came back. Give it a 40 minute moba mode and expect to print money.

            This game ended up taking more from traditional MOBA experiences and
            making them into an intense PVP experience. <br />
            This game did so much right, it's wild. From the pvp system, to
            having good PVE (looking at you OW2) to the smart build system.
            <br />
            I think gamers are ready to try it again. This game and lawbreakers had some... Horrendous timing and PR when it came to marketing. I think now that enough time has passed, people don't care.

            Welp. That aged like milk.... <br />
            What's there to say? This game was great, but it's not an
            exceptionally deep game. I think it failed because if you played it
            for 3 hours, you might as well have played it for 300. The game
            didn't have a complex meta system, and matches felt pretty samey
            after a while. It would've really benefitted from a longer, more
            hardcore gamemode (Something 30+ minutes, like Dota or LOL) - or
            having multiple gamemodes (like Smite)

            I used to play this game all the time on the XBOX 360. It's a super
            fun third person shooter. Adding the economic element, and allowing
            players to invest into turrets/attack bots is SUCH a cool concept. I
            love it.
