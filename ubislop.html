    <br> I have a pretty complex history with the artform of video games. When I was a kid, I'd play just about anything I could get my hands on. I had a lot of fun playing games on my xbox 360, running through so many campaigns. 

    <br> Some of my favorite games were made by Ubisoft. Far cry 3, Assassins creed black flag & 3 (didn't like rayman lol). But I kind of aged out of those games a little. 

    <br> Once I hit middle school, I got a pretty big LOL phase (the dark ages) and played that game way too much. 
    <br> I remember  dropping that game hard and getting into a HUGE ps2 phase, and being obsessed with JRPGs for quite a while. 
    <br> Long story short - From around 2014-now, I've been very distinguishing with my tastes. I want to play games that make me think, that have unique mechanics or are just straight up  classics - cult or otherwise.

    <br> I used to look down on Ubisoft games as being crappy cash cows that just existed to make money and not take any risks. I still do think that way A LITTLE - but man picking up far cry 5 blew my mind.

    <br> It's such a fun game, and it knows exactly what it is. If I have an hour free and I play disco elysium, I don't know if I'd enjoy it that much. If I have an hour free and I play far cry 5, I'm gonna have a BLAST.

    <br> FC5 drip drops dopamine at you constantly. There's always something to do and the game is so combat heavy it's insane.
    <br> the game design is genius, having the progress bars fill up when you do ANYTHING makes the game so damn addictive. I think to myself "one more silo, one more outpost" way too much.

    <br> Sometimes I return from my lab at 9pm, after a full day of work, and far cry 5 is such a good relaxing podcast game it's insane. 
    
    <br> If you haven't played any far cry games in a while (4+ years), I'd reccomend checking out the franchise again. It'll probably be 2028 before I touch far cry 7, but I'm looking forward to it.
