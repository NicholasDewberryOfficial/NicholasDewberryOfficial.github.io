        <td> Was the best Guilty Gear Strive player in NC from March - July 2022.</td>  
        <td> Started working fulltime since I was 17, haven't stopped since. I mostly do tech, so think IT or app development with a copious helping of data science. </td>
        <td> Experience with Unity Game Engine. I've used it the most for working with groups, and it's popular for a reason. </td>
        <td> "How can you listen to this? It's just noise" </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Won over 9 seperate 16+ man tournaments for Guilty Gear Strive (over 600$ earned in total). </td>  
        <td> Pretty diverse set of work done. I typically gravitate towards leadership positions, but only after I have a stretch of learning how to do EVERY task myself. I want that broad perspective and I value it a lot.</td>
        <td> Lots of experience with the Godot game engine. My personal go-to for game development. Too bad people dont know about it. </td>
        <td> "Yes, you're muscular and you lift a lot of weight, but you're not 'fit' because you don't have a six pack" </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> Tournament champion for old anime games like +R, XRD, BBCF, EFZ</td>  
        <td> Started at Guilford Technical Community College, moved to A&T for the job placement programs after graduation. </td>
        <td> I work with the Computational Data Science and Engineering dept. for Data visualization and VR. </td>
        <td> "Why are you planning on going to grad school/making games intead of getting paid immediatley after college" </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> RPG fanatic. I don't like DND, but I play (read: DM) it the most. </td>  
        <td> Hands on knowledge with lots of data structures and performance optimizations. Having a strong gamedev background will give you TONS of skills. </td>
        <td> I trained in IT before moving over to COMPSCI. I've set up networks & firewalls and camera systems before, as well as typical desk job IT stuff. It gives me a great perspective on how this tech is used from different sides. </td>
        <td> "Why do you wake up at 6am everyday, there's no reason for that." </td>

<p> I'm still young, but I'm happy with my career experience and technical knowledge. I focus a lot on trying to give myself a good future. I party hard, but I'm great at choosing the right times to do it (i.e. after I've got all my work done.). </p>
