As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
<p1 id ="underlinedSection"> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</p1>
<p2 id= "orangeTextPart"> It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. </p2>
In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
<p3 id="redTextPart">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...” </p3>
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
<p4 id="redTextPart"> "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower—the image of a rose that shines
through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ." </p4>
And I felt him to be more fragile still.
<p1 id="underlinedSection"> I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff
of wind . . </p1>  </body>
