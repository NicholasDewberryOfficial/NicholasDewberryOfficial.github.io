    There's a TON of problems in society, however there isn't a lot of knowledge about why they matter or even if something is a problem or not.

    <h3> Why do we tolerate strong LED headlights? </h3>
    <br> 
    <p> These are garbage. They have made our roads far less safe. 
    <br> 
    There's so many news stories/anecdotes of people who get hurt from having these on the road. They hurt everyone who isnt the driver A TON.
    <br>
    The craziest part is that they don't even help the driver much! 99% of roads don't need LED lights
    <br> For the small amount of roads that do, you can use normal headlights and drive slower. It's stupid.
    <br> The worst part about all this is the fact that so many people use these and drive extra-high pickup trucks that blind people.
    <br> This would be an easy thing to pass, and an easy thing to catch on inspection.
