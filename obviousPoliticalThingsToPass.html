    There's a TON of problems in society, here's my take on some low hanging fruit we can easily change.

<div class="maincontent"> 
    <h3> Why do we tolerate strong LED headlights? </h3>
    <br> 
    <p> These are garbage. They have made our roads far less safe. 
    <br> 
    There's so many news stories/anecdotes of people who get hurt from having these on the road. They hurt everyone who isnt the driver A TON.
    <br>
    The craziest part is that they don't even help the driver much! 99% of roads don't need LED lights
    <br> For the small amount of roads that do, you can use normal headlights and drive slower. It's stupid.
    <br> The worst part about all this is the fact that so many people use these and drive extra-high pickup trucks that blind people.
    <br> This would be an easy thing to pass, and an easy thing to catch on inspection.

<h3> What's up with these loud *** cars?</h3>
<br>
<p> THIS grinds my gears. Imagine walking down a nice, calm city street then all of a sudden you hear the BRRRRR of a stupidly expensive motorcycle that the rider is renting. It's so dumb!!
<br>
It's unbearably offputting, annoying and rude. I do not consent to having my ears blown out on a nice midsummers day! It makes going on dates in cities annoying too.
<br>
It's also why I don't ever want to sit outside. I know that I'll be chatting about some fun topic, getting really into it - then having my train of thought dislodged by a TROGLODYTE who thought it was a good idea to start revving at a red light.

<br>
You know the worst part???? These guys are so desperate for any type of validation/approval. They make their stupid noises then look around at you like "That's cool, isn't it?" NO! IT'S NOT COOL! CEASE THIS NONSENSE IMMEDIATLEY! 
<br>
Sorry for getting heated. If you have a loud car, that's fine. But please, remember that you're not the only person in the world.

<h3> Where can I refill my water bottle? </h3>
<br>
<p> This is less important than the other stuff, but I want you to follow my story for a second. Imagine you're in a city, relaxing and going about your day. It's hot, so you end up bringing a water bottle and sipping from it. Now, imagine that you've run out of water. What now? <br>
Well, your choices are to:
<ol>
<li> Buy some from a store. This sucks because you're usually spending more money than you should and you're creating pollution (those plastic water bottles gotta go somewhere). </li>
<li> Awkwardly ask someone in a resturant/coffee shop to fill you up. This is fine by me, because I'm ok with being a slight inconvenience to others, but there's gotta be a better solution to me leeching off someone else...</li>
<li> Risk using a public water fountain. I've got a strong immune system - so I'm fine, but this isn't an option for most. </li>
</ol>



<br>
We have the same issue with bathrooms. These are important public utilities that require an large amount of upkeep to maintain, and a large amount of trust that people won't just ruin them. Unfortunatley, there's better things to spend money on, and there's enough bad apples to erode the trust.
